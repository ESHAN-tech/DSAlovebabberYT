/*

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The array can be modified as 
{1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}. 
The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
